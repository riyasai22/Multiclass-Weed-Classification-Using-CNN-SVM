Early identification and removal of plant and weed seedlings is crucial for efficient crop management and weed control. Unwanted weed growth can have a negative impact on crop yield and quality, as they compete with the main crop for nutrients. This paper focuses on a hybrid methodology of using image processing, deep learning and machine learning techniques for the multiclass classification of plant and weeds seedlings. Using a combination of color-based segmentation, contrast enhancement, morphological operations, and CNN-SVM classifier, the proposed technique achieves high accuracy while being computationally ef icient. The proposed technique achieved
a test accuracy of 88.45%, outperforming the existing technique that relied solely on CNNs for feature extraction and classification, which achieved a lower test accuracy of 80%. Comparison is done with existing transfer learning techniques MobileNet and VGG16 for classification, and the proposed model outperforms their performance results. Overall, the proposed technique shows great potential for improving the accuracy and ef iciency of multiclass classification of plant and weed seedlings, which has important implications for plant science and agriculture.
